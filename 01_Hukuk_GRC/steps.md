# Steps — How this evidence pack was built

## Step 1 — Build the 15-week map
- Extract weekly topics from lecture PDFs and summarize them as a “week map”.
- Artifact: `evidence/artifacts/01_week_map.md`
- Screenshot: `evidence/screenshots/01_week_map.png`

## Step 2 — Create the risk register
- Turn major topics (KVKK, cybercrime, digital evidence, e-contracts, IP) into concrete risks.
- Add controls + evidence field for each risk.
- Artifact: `evidence/artifacts/02_risk_register.csv`
- Screenshot: `evidence/screenshots/02_risk_register.png`

## Step 3 — Create the compliance checklist
- Convert obligations and best practices into a checklist that can be “verified”.
- Each checklist item includes what proof would look like.
- Artifact: `evidence/artifacts/03_compliance_checklist.md`
- Screenshot: `evidence/screenshots/03_checklist.png`

## Step 4 — Write the report
- Summarize outcomes + what I learned + how it applies to security roles.
- File: `report.md`
