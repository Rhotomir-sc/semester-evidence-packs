# Steps — How this evidence pack was built

## Step 1 — Build the 15-week map

- Screenshot: `evidence/screenshots/01_week_map.png`

## Step 2 — Create a risk register
- Convert key topics into concrete risks + controls + proof
- Artifact: `evidence/artifacts/02_risk_register.csv`
- Screenshot: `evidence/screenshots/02_risk_register.png`

## Step 3 — Create a compliance checklist
- Convert obligations/best practices into verifiable checklist items
- Artifact: `evidence/artifacts/03_compliance_checklist.md`
- Screenshot: `evidence/screenshots/03_checklist.png`

## Step 4 — Write the report
