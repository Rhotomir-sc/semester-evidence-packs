# Plan — Information Systems Law (IT Law & Compliance)

## Scope
- Produce a clear 15-week topic map from the course materials.
- Convert the topics into a practical mini-pack:
  1) Risk register
  2) Compliance checklist

## Out of scope
- Detailed legal advice or case-law deep dive (this is an evidence/portfolio pack).

## Evidence to collect
- Artifacts: 3 files (week map + risk register + checklist)
- Screenshots: 3 images (one per artifact)

## Success criteria
- README links to correct artifact filenames.
- Steps reference exact evidence filenames.
- Report explains “how this helps cybersecurity work” in concrete bullets.
