# Report — Information Systems Law (IT Law & Compliance)

## Summary
- Built a practical “mini audit pack” from the course: a 15-week topic map + risk register + compliance checklist.
- Translated legal topics (KVKK, cybercrime, digital evidence, 5651, e-contracts, IP/industrial rights) into operational controls and evidence requirements.
- Focused on an “evidence-first” mindset: what to log, what to retain, what to document, and how to prove compliance.

## Key outputs
- Week map: `evidence/artifacts/01_week_map.md`
- Risk register: `evidence/artifacts/02_risk_register.csv`
- Compliance checklist: `evidence/artifacts/03_compliance_checklist.md`

## What I learned (HR-friendly)
- Privacy/compliance (KVKK) directly shapes security design: minimization, lawful basis, access control, and request workflows.
- Correct logging (IP/port/timestamp mindset) and retention are critical for attribution and incident response.
- Cybercrime awareness: why least privilege, monitoring, and security training reduce legal exposure.
- Digital evidence basics: integrity mindset (hashing + chain-of-custody) and why investigations fail without documentation.
- Provider responsibility logic (5651 overview): roles and workflows for takedown/access actions (owner + escalation).
- E-contract/e-signature proof mindset: storing consent/version records reduces disputes and supports accountability.
- Ads/unfair competition: approval and consent-based marketing are compliance controls, not just business choices.
- IP/industrial rights online: counterfeit listings, domain squatting, and design misuse require reporting/escalation + evidence collection.

## Improvements (next time)
- Add a 1-page scenario: “counterfeit product listing → takedown → evidence checklist” to make the pack more case-based.
- Add a simple diagram: provider roles and who does what during takedown/escalation.
