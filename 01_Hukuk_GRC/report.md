# Steps — How this evidence pack was built

## Step 1 — Build the 15-week map
- Extract weekly topics from PDFs/lecture notes
- Artifact: `evidence/artifacts/01_week_map.md`
- Screenshot: `evidence/screenshots/01_week_map.png`

## Step 2 — Create a risk register
- Identify 8–12 typical risks (privacy, logging, access control, retention, breach notification, etc.)
- Artifact: `evidence/artifacts/02_risk_register.csv`
- Screenshot: `evidence/screenshots/02_risk_register.png`

## Step 3 — Create a compliance checklist
- Convert key obligations into a checklist (do/don’t + evidence)
- Artifact: `evidence/artifacts/03_compliance_checklist.md`
- Screenshot: `evidence/screenshots/03_checklist.png`

## Step 4 — Write the report
- Summarize what I learned + how it applies to cybersecurity roles
- File: `report.md`
