## Summary
- I built a STRIDE-lite threat model for my portfolio + GitHub evidence system and converted risks into actionable controls.
- I documented mitigations and defined what “evidence” would prove each control.

## Evidence
- Threat model: `evidence/artifacts/lab01_threat_model.md`
- Risk register: `evidence/artifacts/lab01_risk_register.csv`
- Controls checklist: `evidence/artifacts/lab01_controls_checklist.md`
- Screenshots under `evidence/screenshots/`

## What I learned (HR-friendly)
- How to structure security thinking using a threat model instead of ad-hoc assumptions.
- How to translate threats into mitigations and verifiable evidence.
- How to reduce information disclosure risks in public portfolios while keeping proof of skills.

## Improvements
- Add a small “hardening sprint” (2FA, branch protection) with before/after evidence.
- Add a short abuse case: “impersonation profile + reporting + verification steps.”
