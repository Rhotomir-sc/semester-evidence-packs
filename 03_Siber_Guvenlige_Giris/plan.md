# Plan — Mini-Lab 01: Threat Model (STRIDE-lite) + Risk Register

## Goal
- Build a structured threat model for a simple system and convert it into actionable controls and evidence.
- Show security reasoning: threat → risk → mitigation → proof.

## System
- Student portfolio + GitHub evidence repositories (public-facing)

## Deliverables
- `evidence/artifacts/lab01_system_overview.md`
- `evidence/artifacts/lab01_threat_model.md`
- `evidence/artifacts/lab01_risk_register.csv`
- `evidence/artifacts/lab01_controls_checklist.md`

## Evidence (screenshots)
- Threat model preview
- Risk register table view
- Controls checklist preview

## Success criteria
- Threat categories cover STRIDE-lite.
- Risks have impact/likelihood + mitigation + evidence field.
- Checklist items are verifiable (proof-oriented).
