# Lab Plan — Operating Systems (Practice & Administration)

## Goal
Create a small evidence pack by reviewing Windows Security logs (login events) and documenting findings clearly.

## What this proves
I can collect OS-level evidence, filter relevant events, and summarize results in a short report.

## Tools
- Windows Event Viewer (Security log)
- (Optional) PowerShell
- Screenshot tool

## Evidence to collect
- 4–6 screenshots (filters + selected events + summary view)
- 1 small artifact (notes or exported event list)
