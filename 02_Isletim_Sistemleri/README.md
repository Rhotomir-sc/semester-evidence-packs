## Goal
- Prove practical OS administration skills: users/groups, permissions, processes, logging, and basic hardening.

## Environment
- OS: <Windows/Linux + version>
- Tools: <Task Manager / PowerShell / Bash / journalctl / etc.>

## What I did
1) Planned the scope → `plan.md`
2) Executed steps → `steps.md`
3) Collected evidence → `evidence/`
4) Wrote results → `report.md`

## Evidence Index

### Artifacts

- evidence/artifacts/02_<...>.conf — <1 line explanation>

## Result / What I learned
