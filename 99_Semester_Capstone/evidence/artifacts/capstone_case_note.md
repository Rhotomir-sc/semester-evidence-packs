# Capstone Case Note (Mini SOC)

## Signal
- Suspicious login failures + unusual connections (simulated narrative)

## Triage (what I checked)
- OS pack: sudo visibility + services/ports baseline + journald sudo events
- Networks pack: DNS visibility + TLS handshake baseline
- Cyber pack: threat → risk → control mapping
- Law/GRC pack: compliance checklist mindset
- Programming pack: CSV output as repeatable reporting proof

## Evidence links
- `../../01_Hukuk_GRC/`
- `../../02_Isletim_Sistemleri/`
- `../../03_Siber_Guvenlige_Giris/`
- `../../04_Bilgisayar_Aglari/`
- `../../05_Programlama_1/`

## Result
A single entry point that connects Semester 1 evidence packs into an investigation-style flow.
