# Report — Semester 1 Capstone (Mini SOC Investigation Pack)

## Summary
- I packaged Semester 1 work into evidence-based mini deliverables per course.
- I linked OS, network, threat/risk, compliance, and automation artifacts into a single incident-style narrative.

## Strongest evidence
- IT Law/GRC: risk register + compliance checklist
- OS: baseline + journald sudo evidence + services/ports snapshot
- Networks: baseline PCAP + DNS filter + TLS handshake proof
- Programming: C parser → CSV output

## Result
A compact, reviewable portfolio showing structured security reasoning and reproducible evidence.
