# Report — Semester 1 Capstone

## Summary
- I packaged Semester 1 work into evidence-based mini deliverables per course.
- Each pack includes plan, steps, report, and verifiable outputs (screenshots/artifacts).

## Strongest evidence
- IT Law/GRC: risk register + compliance checklist
- Kali OS: baseline + journald sudo evidence
- Networks: PCAP baseline + DNS/TLS filter proof
- Programming: C parser → CSV report output

## Result
A compact, reviewable portfolio showing structured security reasoning and reproducible evidence.
