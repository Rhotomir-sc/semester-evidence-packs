# Fall 2025–2026 — Evidence Packs (SUBÜ Cybersecurity)

This repository contains my practical evidence packs from the **Fall 2025–2026 semester** in the **Cybersecurity program** at
**SUBÜ (Sakarya University of Applied Sciences)**, IT Technologies Vocational School (Associate Degree).

For each course, I built a small mini-lab and documented it in a clear structure:
**plan → steps → report → evidence (screenshots/artifacts)**.
