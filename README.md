# Fall 2025–2026 — Evidence Packs (SUBÜ Cybersecurity)

![Top 3 Evidence](./99_Semester_Capstone/evidence/screenshots/capstone_top3.png)

This repository contains my practical evidence packs from the Fall 2025–2026 semester in the Cybersecurity program at SUBÜ (Associate Degree).

For each course, I built a small mini-lab and documented it in a clear structure:
**plan → steps → report → evidence (screenshots/artifacts)**
